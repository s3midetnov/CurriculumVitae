# RenderCV Pipeline

Are you ready to revolutionize the way you manage and craft your CVs and resumes?

Picture this:

1.  You simply update your `src/John_Doe_CV.yaml` input file and push the changes.
2.  Then, a pipeline generates a new PDF and Markdown from it and uploads it to the repository.
3.  When you are done with your work, you can create a new release on GitHub, tagging your CV with something like `v2024.04`. The pipeline will automatically add the PDF and its $\LaTeX$ source as assets to the release.
4.  You have successfully created your CV pipeline, and all the history is in safe hands and reproducible.

**How to start?**

1.  [Click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=rendercv-pipeline&template_owner=sinaatalay) to create your CV repository based on this `rendercv-pipeline` template repository.
2.  Edit either
    -  the `src/John_Doe_CV.yaml` file, or
    -  the contents of `src/markdown` or `src/classic` directories
    
    and push. Then, see the magic happen.

**Some tips**

-  Learn more about [RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) to understand what you can do with this tool.
-  Edit and preview your CV in your browser without installing anything by creating a codespace. Click the <> **Code** button, then click the **Codespaces** tab, and then click **Create codespace on main**. The environment will be ready for RenderCV usage. Update `.vscode/launch.json` to point to your YAML file and press `F5` to run RenderCV in the browser.

# Work Experience

## JetBrains, Research Intern in HoTT and Dependent Types Lab

- June 2024 – Sept 2024
- Pafos, Cyprus
- I was developing the official library in the Arend language. I formalized different results in algebra and homotopy type theory, including following.
- Formalized Eckmann-Hilton argument, Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, Homologies of types.
- Formalized automorphisms of groups, Schur's Lemma, Maschke's Lemma, Group actions characterizations. (Some of these results are in the \href{https://arend-lang.github.io/2024/07/05/Arend-1.10.0-released.html}{1.10 release})

## IPONWEB (acquired by Criteo), Machine Learning Intern

- May 2023 – Sept 2023
- Pafos, Cyprus
- Criteo has a ML tool that analyzes sites and produces word-2-vec representations. In IPONWEB I was trying to reverse-engineer the behaviour of this tool and analyze its possible applications.
