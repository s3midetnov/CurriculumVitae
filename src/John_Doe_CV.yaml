    #   - '[RenderCV](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv) is
    #     a LaTeX-based CV/resume framework. It allows you to create
    #     a high-quality CV or resume as a PDF file from a YAML
    #     file, with **full Markdown syntax support** and **complete
    #     control over the LaTeX code**.'
    #   - The boilerplate content was inspired by [Gayle McDowell](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).
    # quick_guide:
    #   - bullet: Each section title is arbitrary and each section
    #       contains a list of entries.
    #   - bullet: 'There are 7 unique entry types: *BulletEntry*,
    #       *TextEntry*, *EducationEntry*, *ExperienceEntry*, *NormalEntry*,
    #       *PublicationEntry*, and *OneLineEntry*.'
    #   - bullet: Select a section title, pick an entry type, and
    #       start writing your section!

        highlights:
          - I was developing the official library in the Arend language. I formalized different results in algebra and homotopy type theory, including following. 
          - Formalized Eckmann-Hilton argument, Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, Homologies of types. 
          - Formalized automorphisms of groups, Schur's Lemma, Maschke's Lemma, Group actions characterizations. (Some of these results are in the \href{https://arend-lang.github.io/2024/07/05/Arend-1.10.0-released.html}{1.10 release})

        highlights:
          - Criteo has a ML tool that analyzes sites and produces word-2-vec representations. In IPONWEB I was trying to reverse-engineer the behaviour of this tool and analyze its possible applications.
