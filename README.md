# Education

## Saint-Petersburg State University, BSc in Mathematics

- 2021 – 2025

## Neapolis University Of Pafos, BSc in Applied Computer Science JetBrains Program

- 2022 – 2024

## Geneva University, MSc in Mathematics

- 2025 – 2027

# Work Experience

## JetBrains, Research Intern in HoTT and Dependent Types Lab

- Nov 2025 – present
- Remote

## JetBrains, Research Intern in HoTT and Dependent Types Lab

- June 2024 – Sept 2024
- Pafos, Cyprus
- I was developing the official library in the Arend language. I formalized different results in algebra and homotopy type theory, including following.
- Formalized Eckmann-Hilton argument, Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, Homologies of types.
- Formalized automorphisms of groups, Schur's Lemma, Maschke's Lemma, Group actions characterizations. (Some of these results are in the [1.10 release](https://arend-lang.github.io/2024/07/05/Arend-1.10.0-released.html)).

## IPONWEB (acquired by Criteo), Machine Learning Intern

- May 2023 – Sept 2023
- Pafos, Cyprus
- Criteo has a ML tool that analyzes sites and produces word-2-vec representations. In IPONWEB I was trying to reverse-engineer the behaviour of this tool and analyze its possible applications.
