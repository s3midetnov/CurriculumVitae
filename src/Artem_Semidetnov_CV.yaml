        highlights:
          - I was developing the official library in the Arend language. I formalized different results in algebra and homotopy type theory, including following. 
          - Formalized Eckmann-Hilton argument, Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, Homologies of types. 
          - Formalized automorphisms of groups, Schur's Lemma, Maschke's Lemma, Group actions characterizations. (Some of these results are in the [1.10 release](https://arend-lang.github.io/2024/07/05/Arend-1.10.0-released.html)).

        highlights:
          - Criteo has a ML tool that analyzes sites and produces word-2-vec representations. In IPONWEB I was trying to reverse-engineer the behaviour of this tool and analyze its possible applications.
