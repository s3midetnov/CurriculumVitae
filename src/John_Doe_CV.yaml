    #   - bullet: Each section title is arbitrary and each section
    #       contains a list of entries.
    #   - bullet: 'There are 7 unique entry types: *BulletEntry*,
    #       *TextEntry*, *EducationEntry*, *ExperienceEntry*, *NormalEntry*,
    #       *PublicationEntry*, and *OneLineEntry*.'
    #   - bullet: Select a section title, pick an entry type, and

        highlights:
          - I was developing the official library in the Arend language. I formalized different results in algebra and homotopy type theory, including following. 
          - Formalized Eckmann-Hilton argument, Eilenberg-Maclane spaces, Homologies of types. 
          - Formalized automorphisms of groups, Schur's Lemma, Maschke's Lemma, Group actions characterizations. (Some of these results are in the \href{https://arend-lang.github.io/2024/07/05/Arend-1.10.0-released.html}{1.10 release})

        highlights:
          - Criteo has a ML tool that analyzes sites and produces word-2-vec representations.
          In IPONWEB I was trying to reverse-engineer the behaviour of this tool and analyze its possible applications.
